        UI is made up of all the <b>elements</b> that enable someone to interact
        with a product or service. UX, on the other hand, is what the individual
        interacting with that <del>product</del> or service takes away from the
        entire experience.

      In the last few weeks, because of a combination of various things at work,
      and in side-projects, I've been learning a lot about web fonts and also a
      lot more about Google Fonts specifically. Through that I've come up with a
      more nuanced answer to the question, that in the past I thought was easy:
      should you self-host Google Fonts?
