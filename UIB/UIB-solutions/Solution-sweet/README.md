> - You will need to use the pseudo classes `:hover`, `:active` and `:visited`
> - The text under the two **subtopic** headers changes color on `:hover`
> - The links at the bottom of the main page and under **Contact Information** are in lists and change color on `:hover`
> - The web links have an `:active` class applied and should open in a new tab
> - `:visited` pseudo classes should be applied to the internal links, **Drop me a line!** and **Back to main page**
