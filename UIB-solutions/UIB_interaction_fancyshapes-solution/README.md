# I'm so fancy

**Instructions**: 

**Task 1** 
* Create a section with the class `task-one`. 
* Inside the section, add `lorem ipsum` text of around 30 characters. 
* Use the css-pseudo selectors `:before` and `:after` to add "Once upon a time ..." before the text and "...The end." after the text.

**Task 2**
* Create a section with the class `task-two`. 
* Use the `beach.jpg` image in the assets folder as a background image for the section element. 
* Change the shape of the element from a box-shape to a rhombus-shape.

**Task 3**
* Create an image element with the class `task-three`. Add the `smiley.jpg` image to the image element. 
* Rotate the image 180 degrees to show the smiley upside-down.
