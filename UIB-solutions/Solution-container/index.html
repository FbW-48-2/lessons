      <h2>Containers Everywhere</h2>
      <p>
        Have you ever asked yourself how does the coffee or tea that you are
        drinking get to your table? Your coffee, your laptop, and your mobile
        phone were all, for sure, shipped in a container. Containers carry a
        large percentage of the goods that impact our daily lives. We can not
        understand globalization without referring to containers. The importance
        of these steel boxes is undeniable.
