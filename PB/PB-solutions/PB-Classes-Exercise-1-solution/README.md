### JS Classes

Create the instance properties `fullname` and `email` in the `Employee` class. Given a person's first and last names:

Form the `fullname` by simply joining the first and last name together, separated by a space.
Form the `email` by joining the first and last name together with a `.` in between, and follow it with `@company.com` at the end. Make sure the entire email is in lowercase.
Examples

```
emp1 = Employee("John", "Smith")
emp1.fullname ➞ "John Smith"

emp2 = Employee("Mary",  "Sue")
emp2.email ➞ "mary.sue@company.com"

emp3 = Employee("Antony", "Walker")
emp3.firstname ➞ "Antony"

```
* Note :- The properties firstname and lastname are already made for you.
