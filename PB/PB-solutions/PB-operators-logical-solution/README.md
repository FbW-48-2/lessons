# Programming Basics: Logical Operators

These exercises are aimed at making you familiar with logical operators. **Print all your checks to the console. Make sure that you are using the *correct* logical operator.**

0. Declare two variables: `isDogBetter` with the value of `true`, and `isCatBetter` with the value of `false`.

1. Check the result of:

- a) isDogBetter AND isCatBetter.

- b) isDogBetter OR isCatBetter.

- c) NOT (isDogBetter AND isCatBetter).

2. Declare three more variables `atoms`, `sandGrains`, `starsInSky`. Give these variables number values.

3. Check the result of whether:

- a) `atoms` is greater than `starsInSky` AND `atoms` is greater than `sandGrains`.

- b) `atoms` is NOT equal to `sandGrains`.

- c) `starsInSky` is less than `sandGrains` OR `starsInSky` is greater than `atoms`.

- d) `atoms` is equal to `starsInSky` OR `atoms` is NOT equal to `sandGrains`.

- e) `atoms` is greater than or equal to 10 AND `sandGrains` is less than or equal to 10.

- f) `atoms` multiplied by `starsInSky` is less than 100 OR whether `atoms` multiplied by `sandGrains` is greater than 100.

4. BONUS: In your own words, explain the logic of each result in a comment after the result.
