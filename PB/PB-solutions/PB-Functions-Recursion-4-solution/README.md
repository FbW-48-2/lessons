# Recursion

#### Find the nth Fibonacci number
* Write a JavaScript program to get the first n Fibonacci numbers.

* Note: The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . . Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
- fibonnaci(0)=> [0]
- fibonnaci(1)=> [0,1]
- fibonnaci(2)=> [0,1,1]
- fibonnaci(8)=> [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,21]
 
```javascript
    fibonnaci(8) //  [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,21]  
```
