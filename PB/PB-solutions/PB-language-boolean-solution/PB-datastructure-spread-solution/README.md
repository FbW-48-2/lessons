# Spread the Word

#### 1. Combining Arrays 
* Create two arrays. e.g. euroCountries and asianCountries. Add asianCountries items to the end of euroCountries array. 
* Once again create two arrays. Save all elements of both arrays to another variable. 

#### 2. Copying Arrays
* Copy an array using the spread operator. Store the copied array in another variable. 

#### 3. Find the Largest... 
Create a function to find the largest number in an array.

#### 4. Find the Smallest
Create a function to find the smallest number in an array.

#### 5. Clone and Merge
Given two objects:
```javascript
const person = {name: "John"}
const job = {role: "Teacher"}
```
* 5.1 Clone the person object.
* 5.2 Merge these two objects into one object: "employee". Use the spread operator to do so. 
* 5.3 Then change the values of the properties in the employee object.

#### Bonus: 6.  Is the average a whole number?
Create a function that takes 4 integers as parameters and returns true or false depending on whether the average of all the arguments is a whole number or not.
* Examples
* isWhole(1, 2, 3, 4) ➞ false
* isWhole(9, 2, 2, 5) ➞ false

* Once you have created a function, pass in an array as an argument which contains four elements - check if this method still outputs the correct result!
