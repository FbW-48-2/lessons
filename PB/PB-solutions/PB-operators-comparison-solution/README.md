# Programming Basics: Comparison Operators

These exercises are aimed at making you familiar with the comparison operators. **Print all your checks to the console.**

0. Declare two variables "apples" and "oranges". Assign a value of 20 to apples. Assign a value of 30 to oranges.

7. Subtract mangoes from apples and check whether this result is less than oranges divided by mangoes.

8. Check whether mangoes, apples and oranges are equal.

9. Check whether the remainder of apples divided by mangoes and the remainder of oranges divided by mangoes are equal.

10. Check whether mangoes added to apples is greater than oranges minus mangoes. If it is not, find an operator which will give a result of true.
