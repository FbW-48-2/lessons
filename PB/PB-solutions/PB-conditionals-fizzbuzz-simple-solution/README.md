# Programming Basics: Fizzbuzz (using simple if conditionals)

Let's play mini FizzBuzz! For any given number, if the number is: 
- divisible by 3, print "Fizz". 
- divisible by "5", print "Buzz". 
- divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz". 

That is, if any of the above conditions apply, print the above words *instead of the number*.

- Otherwise, just print the number.
