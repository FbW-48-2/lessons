### Closure

1. In your own words, define closure (1-2 sentences).
* A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

2. Study the following code, then answer the questions below.

```js
function personalDice(name){
  return function(){
      // generate random number between 1 and 6
    const newRoll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6);
    console.log(`${name} rolled a ${newRoll}`)
  }
}

const dansRoll = personalDice("Dan");

const zoesRoll = personalDice("Zoe");


dansRoll();
dansRoll();
```

* a. Where is closure used in this code? How can you tell?
  * name argument passes in personalDice function get stored in closure.Every time you call inner function it will pick name from closure. 

* b. Compare and contrast calling `dansRoll` the first and second time. What is always the same? What could change?
  * First and Second time name is same only dice number is changing.
* c. What is the lexical scope of `newRoll`? 
  * inner functional Scope


3. Write a function that would allow you to do this using a closure.

```js
var addSix = createBase(6);
addSix(10); // returns 16
addSix(21); // returns 27
```
