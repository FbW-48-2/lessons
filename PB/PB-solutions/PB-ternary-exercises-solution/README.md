# Programming Basics: Ternary

These exercises are designed to make you more comfortable with the ternary operator. 

1. Declare a variable named isDog. If true, print 'pat, pat' and if not, print 'find me a dog to pat!'

2. Declare a variable named speedCheck. If speedlimit is 50km/h, and your speed is above that, print 'you're going too fast!'. If speed is lower than 50km/h, print 'You're driving below the speed limit, Oma'.

3. Declare a variable named age. If age is below 16, print "serve butter beer". Otherwise print "serve beer".

4. Declare a variable named isStudent. If true, print "Ticket costs €5,00". If false, print "Ticket costs €12,00".

5. Declare a variable named okMarie. Check if there is 'cake' - if so, print "Let them eat cake". If not, print "Oh, bother". 

6. Check if the following numbers are even numbers. Use a ternary and if the number is even print `30 is even`, else print that it is odd.
* 30
* 939
* 40.9
