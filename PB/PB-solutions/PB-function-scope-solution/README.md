# Function Scope

#### 1. Print Exponential Values
* Write a function that accepts two numbers and validate that they are numbers. 

After that, the function should print _y_ exponential values starting from _x_.

* For example if we have function(3, 5) The function should print `3 9 27 81 243`. Prints 5 exponential values of 3.
* function(2, 8) The function prints `2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256`. Prints 8 exponential values of 2.

#### 2. Fruits
* Create a function named `printFavoriteFruit`. Declare a variable outside of the function and store your favorite fruit as a value. Reassign the variable within the function and print "My favorite fruit is: _x_". 

#### 3. Multiply a Number by Itself
* Create a function named `exponent` that takes two numbers as parameters. The second parameter defines how many times the first number should be multiplied by itself. Save the output in a variable named `result`. 
* Then, try to access the variable `result` outside of the `exponent` function. Is this possible? Why/Why not? Comment your answer in the `index.js` file.
